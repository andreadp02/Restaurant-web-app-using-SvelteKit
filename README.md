Web app containing an example of home page, about, contact and a dynamic menu of a restaurant. After the authentication it is possible to manage the menu and the allergenes for each dish of the menu.

Project created and developed through SvelteKit.
Also, I used TypeScript, Bootstrap and SQLite (better-sqlite3).
